Here you can find activities to
practise your reading skills. 
Reading will help you to improve 
your understanding of the language 
and build your vocabulary.

The self-study lessons in 
this section are written 
and organised according to 
the levels of the Common European Framework 
of Reference for languages (CEFR). T
here are different types of texts and 
interactive exercises that practise the 
reading skills you need to 
do well in your studies, 
to get ahead at work and 
to communicate in English 
in your free time.
